Course Description:
This course provides a no-code, no-math introduction to AI. It is the first of its kind offered in the university setting. At Saras, students take this course in the first semester, whereas introductory AI courses are typically offered in the sophomore or junior year and require coding, math, and algorithms as prerequisites.
This course will provide a broad understanding of artificial intelligence, including its historical origins, its technical foundations, its various branches and sub-branches, and the tasks it's capable of, with a focus on machine learning, deep learning, generative AI, and game playing/robotics. In addition to diverse real-world applications, this course will explore the role and impact of AI on our society, including ethical considerations, the job market, and what AI can reveal about human intelligence. The course will conclude by looking into the future of AI and how it may continue to change our world.
